# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2026-01-01

**Wordspotting** ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

*   **Local Storage**: All your preferences, including your list of keywords and allowed websites, are stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`). This data effectively stays within your Chrome browser and is synced across your devices if you have Chrome Sync enabled.
*   **No Analytics**: We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools.
*   **No External Servers**: The extension operates entirely client-side. No data is sent to any external servers.

## 2. Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions to function:

*   **Host Permissions (`*://*/*`)**: Required to scan the text of webpages you visit. However, the extension **only** scans pages that match the specific domains you have explicitly added to your "Allowed Websites" list.
*   **Notifications**: Used to display system notifications when a keyword is found.
*   **Storage**: Used to save your settings locally.

## 3. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 4. Contact Us
